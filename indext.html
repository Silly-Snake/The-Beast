            One beautiful Saturday morning Jack Crow and his kids were watching the news. They heard that a cereal killer was on the loose where the street that his kids went to school on. Milly, one of his youngest kids said, “I don’t want to go to school.” Jack told the school principal about it, but he did not listen and they had to go to school.
            
            Two days later Milly, John, and Vencen had to go to school. Once they got there, the principal told the school staff to keep an eye on those three. Once school was done, the three children came home to watch a movie. However, Vencen, the middle brother, saw a mysterious black figure in the alley.
            
            “Dad,” Vencen said. “I saw a black figure in the alley.” “Could just be your imagination,” Jack said. Vencen was so scared that he would not even watch the movie. “Knock knock knock.” “I will get it,” said John. When he opened the door, no one was there.
            
            That night, Vencen could not sleep. He was shivering because he was so scared. He started getting cold and got goosebumps. “Who was knocking on the door?” He thought to himself. He kept feeling a cold rush of wind. Then...
            
            “Knock knock knock” he heard. “It’s nothing,” he said. “Stomp stomp stomp” he heard. “Maybe just the wind?” He thought. Then, the door opened. “Creek” the door went. He saw a black figure. The same figure he saw. Every step the stranger took, Vencen got a little more scared. When suddenly, “AAHHHHHHHHHH!!!”
            
            The next morning it was snowing. John and Milly were so happy that they had no school. They wanted to wake up Vencen to tell him the good news, but he was not in bed. The blankets were on the floor, the window open with all the glass shattered, and his bedroom bookshelf, books, TV, computer, art supplies, and many more were gone.
            
            “DAD! VENCEN IS GONE!” They both screamed loudly. However Jack could hear them but could not get in the room. When John opened the door and closed it, he did not notice that the doorknob was gone. “Look at this,” said Milly. It was a letter. The letter said...
            
            
            
            
            Dear Jack,
            You have done well with the kids. I can do the rest. Meet me in the park at 9:00am tomorrow so we can talk. I took care of Vencen for you. I will give you your money once you get there. Your next task, YOU kill John! Without him, Milly will be defenceless. Do it now and I will pay you more and give you a free chocolate.
            
                                                                            Your Boss,
                                                                                          945
            
            “Dad is going to kill us?” Milly wondered. “We should go there at 9:00 to see what they are up to,” said John. So they snuck out the open window and went back in the house.
            
            That night, John wondered who his dad’s boss was and if he could steal this chocolate.
